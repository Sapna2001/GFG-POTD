/*
Given a binary tree with a value associated with each node, we need to choose a subset of these nodes such that sum of chosen nodes is maximum under a constraint 
that no two chosen node in subset should be directly connected that is, if we have taken a node in our sum then we canâ€™t take its any children or parents in 
consideration and vice versa.
